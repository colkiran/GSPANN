File Handling
-------------
open a file and 

1. read
2. write
3. append


handling text files is easy as it is stored in ascii format, so we don't need drivers

file_handle = open("filename + path", mode)

mode = r - read  - only read the contents of the file
       w - write - only write data into the file
       a - append - write data into the file without disturbing the 		    old contents

open the file and randomly read and write contents into the file

FL.seek(pos, whence)

pos - no of bytes to skip

whence - 0    	- BOF
	 1	- CP
	 2	- EOF
